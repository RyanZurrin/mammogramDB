    Test whether monitoring service detects unexpected heartbeat crash
    Setup:
        1. Write a fake execution log (will be written by startup script)
        2. Run the heartbeat as a thread (will be executed inside a docker container)
            a) wait for the period of heartbeat signal to make sure heartbeat starts
        3. Start monitoring service as a process
    Test:
        1. Test whether HeartBeat keep updating timestamp
            a) wait for three heartbeat periods and make sure updated timestamps are different from each other
        2. Check whether there is no CRASH in execution log
            a) "CRASH:" should not be present in execution log as heartbeat keeps working
        3. Check whether monitoring service can detect CRASH from heartbeat log
            a) terminate heartbeat
            b) wait for more than TIMEOUT of monitoring service and check whether CRASH is detected by the service
